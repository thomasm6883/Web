# Web
My Web project working through the backend of a various web technologies

I worked on connecting my own GraphQL API to send requests initiating queries over to my MongoDB database.
Using GraphQL required me to learn about mongoose as well as GraphQL and how to connect them over express and node.
To help collect Data I had used puppeteer and regex matches

I am currently researching multithreading to make collecting data from Minnesota faster, and potentially the other two states.
